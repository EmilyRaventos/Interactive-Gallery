# Overview

This is a web based to-do list that allows users to add, remove, and check off to-do list items. You are able to write a new task in a text box before cliking the "Add Task" button to add it to the list. If you click the item, it will cross it off. You can also click and highlight that task item (though you'll have to uncross off the item as well). I created this to demonstrate the skills I've learned and developed with JavaScript.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. The focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

Tools I used for this program:

- Visual Studio Code
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

  JavaScript is a widely used programming language. It frequently goes hand in hand with HTML and CSS for front-end development and is commonly used specifically to make features interactive. It is also useful when working with a server and databases.

# Future Work

- I'd change it so you can choose to highlight or cross off, depending on what you want.
- I'd add some html and css to make it more visually appealing.
- I want to learn how to make it adaptive to screen size.
- I'd also like to save the to-do list items for future reference.
