# Interactive Gallery
# Overview
This is an interactive photo gallery. A gallery of images is laid out using basic HTML and CSS. When you select an image, you'll see a lightbox that has more information (ie. title and description). There is also a small preview of the gallery that can be inserted into another page of a website. This preview can scroll through different images using JavaScript. I created this to demonstrate the skills I've learned and developed with JavaScript.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. The focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment
Tools I used for this program:
- Visual Studio Code
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

  JavaScript is a widely used programming language. It frequently goes hand in hand with HTML and CSS for front-end development and is commonly used specifically to make features interactive. It is also useful when working with a server and databases.

# Future Work
- I'd change the size of the lightbox, and the opacity of the background.
- I want to look into other options for the scrolling gallery preview feature. I'll experiment with the arrow moving the images over one at a time instead of five at a time.
- I want to learn how to make it adaptive to screen size.
